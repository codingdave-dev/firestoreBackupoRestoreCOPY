Although your application was highly valued we were not able to select and assign you during the final process. However, we have placed your name and application on our waitlist. As you can imagine the acceptance process is not only highly competitive but also limited as we receive many applications for less than 200 seats.</p>\n<p>Our notification and assignment of all waitlisted applicants will occur after {{notificationDate}}. Please note at this juncture there will be no re-assignments and it is highly unlikely that scholarship funds will be available.</p>\n<p>Once notified you must respond within 24 hours that you accept your assignment and your full payment must be paid ASAP.</p>\n<p>I know that you may feel disappointed that you weren&rsquo;t selected initially, but rest assured this in no way diminishes your amazing accomplishments or our interest in you. We simply do not have enough available spaces even for qualified applicants. We are working hard to make this less the case in the future.</p>\n<p>All the Best!</p>\n<p>LEAD Application Review Team</p>\n<p>LEADership, Education and Development</p>","type":"string"},"id":{"value":"aqPGbaubEnp8PtCgQpGK","type":"string"}}
